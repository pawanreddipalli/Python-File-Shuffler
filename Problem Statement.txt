Using the python write a program with the features

1. Input: make your program properly process the data sample provided, as follow: 
/home/user/project/ >> directories >> right | >> left. The program should 
automatically identify the total of files on each directory; your application should 
rename a set of all files to sequential numbers, if n files, attribute a number for 
each file by random attribution, counting from 1 all the way to n. 

2. Date: Change the time stamp for date and time of when the file was created to a 
random date and time, back in time up to the last 10 days.

files before they are changed and after they changed; Include both options to set 
the program to run automatically either once a week, or every 30 seconds -- show 
it automatically running 3 times. (3 points)

implementation; 

5. Submission: upload on D2L, source code/scripting/setups documentation and a 
not zipped short video demo 5 to 10 minutes, and ppt presentation; as a comment
